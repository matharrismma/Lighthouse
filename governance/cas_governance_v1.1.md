# Convergent Authority Systems (CAS) Governance Document v1.1

## Abstract
This document outlines the governance protocols for the Convergent Authority Systems (CAS). It emphasizes the importance of provenance and gate proofs in maintaining the integrity and verification of processes within CAS.

## 1. Introduction
The CAS governance framework provides structure and oversight for maintaining effective operations and compliance.

## 2. Key Definitions
- **Convergent Authority Systems (CAS)**: A framework that utilizes decentralized protocols to ensure secure decision-making.
- **Provenance**: The origin or source of data and processes, crucial for maintaining trust within CAS.

## 3. Normative Dependency
This governance document is normatively dependent on the THE WAY Ledger v1.1, which outlines essential protocols concerning hashing, signatures, and validation checks. The referenced document ensures that all transactions and processes within CAS adhere to established security standards.

## 4.2 Normative v1.1 Protocol Block
### Packet Structure
- **Header**: Contains metadata regarding the transaction.
- **Body**: Includes data payload and validation information.

### Commitment and Signature Rules
- All transactions must include a valid signature from at least two gatekeepers.
- Commitment protocol requires that all data modifications go through an approval process validated by gate definitions.

### Gate Definitions
- **Entry Gate**: Validates the entry of new data into the system.
- **Exit Gate**: Ensures data leaving the system follows established protocols.

### Validation Checks
- Regular audits of gate definitions to ensure compliance with the established governance framework.

## Conclusion
The CAS governance framework establishes clear protocols for operational integrity, emphasizing the crucial roles of provenance and gate proofs in the validation process. Adhering to these guidelines ensures the reliability and trustworthiness of all CAS activities.
