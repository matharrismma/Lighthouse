  This is a small example dataset demonstrating the format for uploading
  molecular property data. It contains synthetic data for demonstration purposes.
  
  The dataset includes:
  - Molecular identifiers (SMILES notation)
  - Molecular weight
  - LogP (partition coefficient)
  - Number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors
