# Reliability and Safety

## Overview
This document covers the broad aspects of reliability and safety in engineering systems. It aims to provide insights into methodologies and practices to ensure the systems are reliable and safe to operate, focusing on operational and development phases.

## Reliability
### Definition
Reliability refers to the ability of a system to perform its intended function under specified conditions for a specified period.

### Key Factors
- **Performance metrics:** How well does the system perform?
- **Failure rates:** What are the anticipated failure rates over time?
- **Maintenance:** What maintenance strategies are in place to ensure reliability?

## Safety
### Definition
Safety is concerned with the absence of unacceptable risks within a system.

### Key Areas
- **Hazard Analysis:** Identifying potential hazards and their risks.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** What measures are taken to eliminate or reduce risks?
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensuring all operations meet safety regulations and standards.

## Conclusion
Broadening the scope to include both reliability and safety helps ensure that engineering projects not only meet performance targets but also operate within safe parameters. This strengthens the overall integrity of engineering practices.
