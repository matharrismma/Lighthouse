# Lighthouse
Lighthouse is an alignment-first knowledge engine that turns chats, docs, and datasets into verifiable evidence and reproducible findings. It keeps an append-only Evidence Ledger (timestamps + hashes), links claims to sources, and formalizes math. Goal: remove contradiction, reduce entropy, and make progress irreversible.
